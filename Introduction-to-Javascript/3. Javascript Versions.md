The core language of **JavaScript** is standardized by the [**ECMA TC39**](https://github.com/tc39) committee as a language named **ECMAScript**. While "ECMAScript" refers to the language standard, the terms "ECMAScript" and "JavaScript" can be used interchangeably. This core language is also utilized in non-browser environments, such as [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/).

**ECMAScript** defines several critical aspects of the language, including:
- **Language syntax**: Parsing rules, keywords, control flow, object literal initialization, etc.
- **Error handling mechanisms**: Features like `throw`, `try...catch`, and the ability to create user-defined `Error` types.
- **Types**: Data types such as boolean, number, string, function, object, etc.
- **Prototype-based inheritance mechanism**
- **Built-in objects and functions**: Including JSON, Math, Array methods, `parseInt`, `decodeURI`, and more.
- **Strict mode**: Learn more about [**Strict Mode**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode).
- **Module system**
- **Basic memory model**

**ECMAScript editions** are published as a standard annually by the [**ECMA General Assembly**](https://tc39.es/ecma262/). The development is conducted publicly via the [**Ecma TC39 GitHub organization**](https://github.com/tc39), where proposals, official specification text, and meeting notes are hosted.

Before the 6th edition (known as **ES6** or **ECMAScript 2015**), specifications were published sporadically and identified by major version numbers like ES3 or ES5. Post-ES6, the naming convention shifted to the publication year—e.g., ES2017, ES2018, etc. **ESNext** is a dynamic term referring to the next version of the standard, though features under ESNext are technically called proposals. These proposals are typically implemented in JavaScript engines once they reach [**Stage 3 or 4**](https://tc39.es/process-document/) and are then available for public use.

The current committee-approved snapshot of [**ECMA-262**](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) is accessible in PDF and HTML formats on the **Ecma International** website. The specifications **ECMA-262** and **ECMA-402** are continuously maintained by the editors, with the latest versions available on the [**TC39 website**](https://tc39.es/).

**New language features**, including syntaxes, APIs, and revisions to existing behaviors, are discussed as [**proposals**](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) within TC39. These proposals progress through a four-stage process, typically reaching implementation in JavaScript engines at Stage 3 or Stage 4.

Since 2015, **major ECMAScript versions** have been released annually each June. The latest edition, [**ECMAScript 2024**](https://tc39.es/ecma262/), was released in June 2024, marking the 15th edition. 

Notable past editions include:
- **ECMAScript 1 (June 1997)**: The first edition.
- **ECMAScript 2 (June 1998)**: A minor update to align with the ISO standard.
- **ECMAScript 3 (December 1999)**: Introduced regular expressions, enhanced string handling, and new control structures like `do-while` and `switch`.
- **ECMAScript 4**: Abandoned due to its complexity.
- **ECMAScript 5 (December 2009)**: Added [**strict mode**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), JSON support, and methods like `String.trim()` and `Array.isArray()`.
- **ECMAScript 2015 (June 2015)**: A major update that introduced features like `let`, `const`, and modules.
- **ECMAScript 2016 (June 2016)**: Introduced a yearly release cycle and added the exponentiation operator and `Array.includes()`.
- **ECMAScript 2017 (June 2017)**: Introduced async functions, shared memory, and other enhancements.

Each year, **ECMAScript** evolves through contributions from a vibrant community and the collaboration of member companies like Adobe, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla, among others. These companies work together through the [**TC39 committee**](https://github.com/tc39), which meets bi-monthly. The minutes of these meetings are publicly available on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/tc39/notes).
