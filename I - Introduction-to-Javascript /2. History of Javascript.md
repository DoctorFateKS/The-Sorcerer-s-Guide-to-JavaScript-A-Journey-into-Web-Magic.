# History of Javascript

JavaScript, a programming language developed by [**Brendan Eich**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) in just ten days in [**May 1995**](https://www.w3.org/History.html), was originally called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, before settling on [**JavaScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). It was created to add dynamic and interactive elements to static HTML pages and was first implemented in [**Netscape Navigator**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator), the most popular browser of the time. [**Microsoft**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer) quickly adopted it for **Internet Explorer**, leading to its widespread use as the only client-side scripting language.

JavaScript's popularity grew rapidly, being used in web applications like online games, dynamic menus, and form validation. It has evolved significantly over the years, with major updates like [**ECMAScript 5**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects) in 2009 and [**ECMAScript 6**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects) in 2015, which introduced features like block-scoped variables ([_let_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) and [_const_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)) and [**arrow functions**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).

JavaScript is now one of the most widely used programming languages, [**essential**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for web development and increasingly used in [**server-side applications**](https://nodejs.org/en/), desktop and mobile apps, and even in programming hardware. The language has a complex history, including its standardization as [**ECMAScript**](https://www.ecma-international.org/) by **ECMA International**, which aimed to resolve browser compatibility issues.

The name **JavaScript**, chosen partly for marketing reasons, has caused some confusion, as it implies a direct connection to the [**Java**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) programming language. During the early web, [**Microsoft’s JScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript) and **Netscape’s JavaScript** led to compatibility challenges. Despite these hurdles, JavaScript became the **de facto standard** for client-side scripting.

The language stagnated during **Internet Explorer's** dominance in the early 2000s, but experienced a renaissance with the introduction of [**Ajax**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX) in 2005, which allowed for dynamic content loading without full page reloads. This led to the development of numerous **JavaScript libraries** and **frameworks**.

In 2009, the creation of [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) extended JavaScript's use beyond browsers, enabling [**server-side applications**](https://nodejs.org/en/). JavaScript's ecosystem has since expanded to include a vast array of tools, libraries, and frameworks, making it **central to modern web development**. The language continues to evolve, with regular updates and a large, active developer community driving its growth.
