# üìú Variable Naming Rules

---

## 1. General Rules
- **Variable names** must start with a **letter**, **underscore** (`_`), or **dollar sign** (`$`).
- No **spaces** are allowed in variable names.
- Variables **cannot** share names with *reserved keywords* like [`if`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) or [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const).
- JavaScript variables are **case-sensitive**, meaning `myVar`, `MyVar`, and `myvar` are distinct.

## 2. Naming Styles

### üê™ camelCase
Used for most variables, functions, and methods. The first letter is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter. Example: [`numberOfUsers`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).

### üÖøÔ∏è PascalCase
Used for *classes and components*, where every word starts with an uppercase letter. Example: `DogCartoon`.

### üî† UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
Reserved for *constants*, where all letters are uppercase, and words are separated by underscores. Example: [`MAX_DOG_WEIGHT`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).

### üêç snake_case & kebab-case
Generally not used in JavaScript for variables but may be seen in other languages or frameworks.

## 3. Variable Naming Best Practices
- Choose **clear, descriptive names** that indicate the variable's purpose. For instance, use `sellingPrice` and `costPrice` rather than `x` and `y`.
- Consider including **type hints** in variable names when appropriate, like [`orderNumber`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) for a numeric ID.

---

## 4. Boolean Naming Conventions
Boolean variables should start with `is`, `are`, or `has` to indicate a true/false condition. Example: [`isTrained`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean), `hasOwner`.

---

## 5. Function Naming
Functions should follow **camelCase** and start with a *verb* to describe their action. Example: [`getName`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions), `calculateDogAgeInHumanYears`.

---

## 6. Class Naming
Classes use **PascalCase**. Example: [`DogBreed`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes). *Constructor functions* are usually named similarly to the class they represent.

---

## 7. Component Naming
Components, especially in frameworks like [React](https://react.dev/), follow **PascalCase**, distinguishing them from native HTML elements. Example: `DogBreedInformation`.

---

## 8. Method Naming
Methods within classes follow the same rules as functions: **camelCase** with a *verb prefix*. Example: `getBreedDetails`.

---

## 9. Private Functions
*Private variables or functions* within classes are typically prefixed with an **underscore (_)** to indicate they should not be accessed directly outside the class or object. Example: [`_toonName`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects).

---

## 10. Global Variables
Use **camelCase** for *mutable global variables* and **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for *immutable ones* to distinguish their purpose.

---

## 11. File Naming
File names should be in *lowercase* to avoid issues with case sensitivity across different servers. Example: `dog-cartoon.js`.

---

### üìå Summary of Best Practices:
- Adhering to these naming conventions ensures *code clarity, maintainability, and readability*, making it easier for others (and your future self) to understand and work with your JavaScript code.
- By following these guidelines, you reduce the risk of errors and make your codebase more *consistent and professional*.
