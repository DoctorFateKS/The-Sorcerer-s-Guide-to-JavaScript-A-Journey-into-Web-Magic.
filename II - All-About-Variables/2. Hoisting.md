# **Hoisting**

**Hoisting** is a JavaScript mechanism where **variables**, **function declarations**, **classes**, and certain other declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the *compilation phase*, prior to the execution of the code. This allows for the use of these entities in code even before they are explicitly declared. However, the way hoisting behaves varies depending on the type of declaration.

### **Hoisting of Different Declarations**

#### **1. Variable Hoisting**

In JavaScript, variables can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`. Each of these has distinct behavior when it comes to hoisting:

- **[`var` Hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var)**: 
  - When a variable is declared using `var`, the *declaration* is hoisted to the top of its scope (either the global scope or the function scope). However, the *initialization* remains in place.
  - The variable is assigned a default value of **`undefined`** at the beginning of the scope, allowing the variable to be referenced before its declaration without throwing an error.
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    console.log(a); // Output: undefined
    var a = 10;
    console.log(a); // Output: 10
    ```
    The above code is interpreted by JavaScript as:
    ```javascript
    var a;
    console.log(a); // Output: undefined
    a = 10;
    console.log(a); // Output: 10
    ```

- **[`let` and `const` Hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)**:
  - Both `let` and `const` are also hoisted to the top of their *block scope*, but unlike `var`, they are not initialized with `undefined`. Instead, they remain uninitialized in what is known as the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** until the actual declaration is encountered in the code.
  - If you try to access a `let` or `const` variable before its declaration, a **`ReferenceError`** is thrown.
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
    let b = 20;
    
    console.log(c); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'c' before initialization
    const c = 30;
    ```
  - The **Temporal Dead Zone** begins at the start of the block until the variable's declaration is encountered.

#### **2. Function Hoisting**

- **[Function Declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)**:
  - *Function declarations* are fully hoisted. This means that the entire function definition is moved to the top of its scope, making the function callable even before its declaration.
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    greet(); // Output: "Hello, World!"
    
    function greet() {
        console.log("Hello, World!");
    }
    ```
    The above code is interpreted by JavaScript as:
    ```javascript
    function greet() {
        console.log("Hello, World!");
    }
    
    greet(); // Output: "Hello, World!"
    ```

- **[Function Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function)**:
  - *Function expressions* (including those created with `var`, `let`, and `const`) are not hoisted in the same way as function declarations. If a function expression is created with `var`, the `var` declaration is hoisted, but the assignment (the function itself) is not. If a function expression is created with `let` or `const`, it follows the same rules as `let` or `const` variable hoisting, meaning they exist in the **temporal dead zone**.
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    console.log(greet); // Output: undefined
    var greet = function() {
        console.log("Hello, World!");
    };
    
    greet(); // Output: "Hello, World!"
    ```
    The above code is interpreted by JavaScript as:
    ```javascript
    var greet;
    console.log(greet); // Output: undefined
    
    greet = function() {
        console.log("Hello, World!");
    };
    
    greet(); // Output: "Hello, World!"
    ```

  - If you attempt to call a function expression before its initialization when declared with `let` or `const`, a **`ReferenceError`** will be thrown.

#### **3. Class Hoisting**

- **[Class Declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)**:
  - Similar to `let` and `const`, *class declarations* are hoisted but remain in the temporal dead zone until they are initialized. Therefore, attempting to access a class before its declaration results in a **`ReferenceError`**.
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    const dog = new Animal(); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'Animal' before initialization
    
    class Animal {
        constructor() {
            console.log("This is an animal");
        }
    }
    ```

- **Class Expressions**:
  - *Class expressions* behave similarly to function expressions and follow the same hoisting rules. They are not hoisted in a way that allows you to access them before the line where they are declared.

### **The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**

The **temporal dead zone** is a term used to describe the period between the beginning of a block and the point where a variable is declared and initialized. During this time, any attempt to access the variable will result in a **`ReferenceError`**. The TDZ applies to variables declared with `let`, `const`, and *classes*.

### **Hoisting of Import Statements**

- **[Import Statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)**:
  - *Import statements* are also hoisted, which means they are processed before any code is executed. However, the entire module is executed first, and then the imports are available for use. 
  - If you try to use an imported module before its entire module is evaluated, it can result in unexpected behaviors.

### **Key Points to Remember**

- **Declarations are hoisted, not initializations**: Only the declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, not the initializations. This can lead to `undefined` values or `ReferenceError` if accessed before the initialization line.
  
- **Use `let` and `const` to avoid issues with hoisting**: Unlike `var`, `let` and `const` enforce a strict scoping rule with TDZ, reducing potential bugs due to unexpected hoisting.

- **Classes behave like `let` and `const`**: They are hoisted but cannot be used before they are declared due to the TDZ.

### **Best Practices to Avoid Hoisting Pitfalls**

1. **Declare variables at the top of their scope**: This aligns with how JavaScript hoists them and reduces confusion.
  
2. **Avoid using `var`**: Prefer `let` and `const` to benefit from block scoping and avoid issues related to `var` hoisting.
  
3. **Understand the TDZ**: Be aware of the temporal dead zone when using `let`, `const`, or class declarations.

4. **Always declare functions before calling them**: Even though functions are hoisted, declaring them at the top of their scope makes the code clearer and easier to understand.

### **Conclusion**

**Hoisting** is an essential concept in JavaScript that can have significant implications on how your code runs. Understanding how hoisting works helps in writing more predictable and bug-free code. By following best practices and being aware of how different types of declarations are hoisted, you can avoid common pitfalls and write cleaner, more reliable JavaScript code.
